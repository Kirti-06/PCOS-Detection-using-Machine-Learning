# PCOS-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
The diagnosis of PCOS is one of the most critical issues in the field of womenâ€™s healthcare. The early identification and detection of PCOS can be aided by the Deep Learning Algorithm.PCOS, highlighting its prevalence, symptoms, and the importance of early detection for improved patient outcomes.

1.Data Collection: In the Kaggle ,The  Datasets included ultrasound pictures of healthy ovaries as well as cystic ovaries .
2. Data Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to ensure its  quality and consistency. This may involve resizing the images, normalizing pixel values, and handling missing or noisy data.
3.Feature Extraction :Extract feature of images such as, to get noise remove, edges,shapes that are relevent for PCOS Deetection.
4.Classification :Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).The focus is on training a CNN model to classify images.
5.Training: The CNN model is trained using the collected dataset.
6.Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a separate test dataset. This helps assess the model's performance in detecting PCOS.
